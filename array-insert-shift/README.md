# Insert to Middle of an Array
 1- Write a function called insertShiftArray which takes in an array and a value to be added. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with the new value added at the middle index.
 
 2- Write a second function that removes an element from the middle index and shifts other elements in the array to fill the new gap.
