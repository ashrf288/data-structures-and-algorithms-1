# Singly Linked List
Create a singly linked list that can instantiate an empty linked list, add to the linked list, confirm if a certain value resides within the list, and can return a string with all of the linked list values.

## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

Write tests to prove the following functionality: 
[X] Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list .

[X] Can properly insert into the linked list.

[X] The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list.
 
[X] Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list.
  
[X] Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists

[X] Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not exist

[X] Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
 

## API
-  (insert)  method : takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

-  (includes) method  : takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

- (toString ) method : takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"->
