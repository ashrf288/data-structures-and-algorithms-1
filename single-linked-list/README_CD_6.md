## Code Challenge :Singly Linked List ,Extending an Implementation.
Extend a Linked List to allow various insertion methods.

# Singly Linked List
       
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:
- (append) method : arguments: new value.
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list.

- (insert_before) method:arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified.

- ( insert_after) method:arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
1. append :  time complexity is big O(n) .
2. insert_before : time complexity is big O(n).  
3. insert_after : time complexity is is  big O(n) .

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
1. append : add new node to the end of the Linked List. 
2. insert before : add new node  before specific old node .
3. insert after : add new node  after specific old node .
